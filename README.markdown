Events Runner
=============

This is Plasma Runner Plugin, which provides you ability to add new events or todos to your calendar from KRunner (Alt+F2). With this runner you may enter into KRunner something like following:

* `event Project deadline; 13.02.2010` - create new event with summary "Project deadline" for 13.02.2010;
* `todo Complete my work; tomorrow 12:30; Business` - create todo with given summary and deadline datetime with category "Business";
* `event Travel to mountains; from yesterday to 31.02.2010; Travel` - create event with given time range and category;
* `event Something; 13:30` - something at 13:30 today;
* `event Other event; yesterday`
* `event Meeting; today from 12:00 to 14:00`
* `todo Buy new phone; in 2 years`
* `todo Complete site design; in 2 days after 10:30`
* And others...

Besides of incident creation you may update existing incidences in some ways:

* `complete Buy new phone` - mark selected task as completed!
* `complete Fix localization issues; 30` - set task as 30%-completed;
* `comment Birthday party; It was cool!` - append some text to task description.
